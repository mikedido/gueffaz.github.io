## ScaleSem
􏰂 2009/2012 􏰐 Dijon,France

The ScaleSem project consists of checking graph properties seman- tics and allow their interrogation. To do this, we have developed tools for transforming and querying semantic graphs based on the Model checking method.
These graphs evolve rapidly and their adaptation to change can re- veal inconsistencies. Driving the application of changes while main- taining the consistency of semantic graphs is a crucial and costly task in terms of time and complexity. An automated process is therefore essential. Model checking is a verification technique that explores all the possible states of the system. In this way, we can show that a model of a given system satisfies a given property.
